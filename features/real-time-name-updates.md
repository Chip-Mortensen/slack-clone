- # Real-Time Name Updates Implementation Plan
-
- ## Overview
-
- Currently, usernames don't update in real-time across the application when profile changes occur. This document focuses specifically on name updates.
-
- ## Affected Components
-
- Primary Components:
-
- - DirectMessageHeader.tsx (shows chat participant's name)
- - MessageList.tsx (shows sender names)
- - Sidebar.tsx (shows conversation list names)
-
- ## Current Implementation
-
- Names are currently:
- - Passed as props to components
- - Only update on page refresh
- - No real-time updates implemented
-
- ## Implementation Strategy
-
- ### 1. Create Name Context
-
- - Create NameContext for managing username updates
- - Subscribe only to username changes in profiles table
- - Implement alongside current prop system initially
-
- [... continue with phases focused only on name updates ...]
